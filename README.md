# ClassChat
ClassChat is a simple C#/.Net system designed to be used for communications and discussions among students in a class. The system is utilizes Clientâ€“Server Communication using TCP/IP, Multi-Thread Communication and Client-Client Communication to transmit encrypted messages.

This project was created using the JetBrains Rider 2022.2.2 IDE and I used C# 10 and .NET 6.0.
To run the program with dotnet, you would need to install the proper dotnet SDK from the Microsoft 
website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

You would also need to install the Rider itself. Rider is paid service but there is a 30-day free trial and UL 
students have free accounts. https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows

Assuming you have these installed correctly, you will be able to open the projects from their directories 
and run them in the IDE.

For the purposes of this 
project, I have created three different project instances in Rider: one server instance and two 
client instances.
